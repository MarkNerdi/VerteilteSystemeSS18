## Usage Instructions

### Start Nodes
1. Start the network handler
2. Start a number of nodes and give them the ip and port as input
3. Choose either to give the node the name of another node or just press enter if you don't want to

### Work with Nodes
* Nodes will automatically register themselves at the Network Handler
* Nodes will automatically send requests every 3 seconds (first to the network handler, then to another node)
